Stuff Marc Antony Said When He Was All Mad

Oh pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth
That I meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou are the ruins of the noblest man
Who ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy

There will be lots of blood and stuff

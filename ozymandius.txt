I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said, "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand
Half sunk, a shatter visage lies
Whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed
